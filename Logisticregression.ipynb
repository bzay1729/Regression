As per the question, our task is to predict the price category of houses (Low, Medium, or High) based on the features such as area, number of rooms, number of bathrooms condition, location. This classification model can be particularly useful for both the buyers and sellers. We can assume  that it could be **deployed** on real estate website or app, where user can input house features and instantly receives a price range prediction. It helps buyers to find the property as per their budget and sellers to list their property pricing as per key features.\n",

        "For our dataset, the 80/20 split is an effective and efficient approach because it ensures that the model has enough data to train on (80%) while leaving sufficient data for validating and testing its performance (20%). Given that the dataset contains 2000 records, this split provides 1600 samples for training and 400 for testing, which is a good balance for evaluating the model's generalization ability.\n",

        "\n",
        "The results show that the model performs exceptionally well, with a consistent 100% accuracy across both training and test data, as well as during cross-validation. This means the model is not only learning the data but also generalizing perfectly to unseen data.\n",
        "\n",
        "The 80/20 split used here, with 1600 samples for training and 400 for testing, seems to be a good choice. It gives the model plenty of data to learn from while still leaving enough to effectively test its performance. The fact that the accuracy remains 100% across different splits confirms that this ratio works well for the dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, achieving perfect accuracy can sometimes be a red flag. While it might seem great, there’s a possibility the model is overfitting—memorizing the data rather than truly learning its patterns. To make sure the model isn’t just fitting the training data too well, it would be a good idea to test it on an entirely different dataset or use more complex data to see how it performs.\n",
        "\n",
        "That said, the 80/20 split clearly serves its purpose here. To further validate the model, we can also consider exploring feature engineering, adding regularization, or testing more advanced models to ensure it stays robust over time.\n"
