# RLogistic Regression Model: Custom vs. scikit-learn

Project Overview
This project involves developing and testing a custom logistic regression model (one-vs-rest) using Newton-CG, gradient descent, and stochastic methods. Optimization techniques such as L1/L2 regularization, steepest descent, and stochastic gradient descent were used to predict house prices categorized as low, medium, and high using the Melbourne housing dataset.

Key Features
Developed custom logistic regression model from scratch using Python.
Implemented optimization techniques (Newton-CG, gradient descent, L1/L2 regularization).
Compared the custom model to scikit-learn’s logistic regression.

Results
Accuracy: Both models achieved 100% accuracy.
Efficiency: scikit-learn’s implementation reduced training time by approximately 90%.
Recommendation: scikit-learn is more efficient for deployment due to its faster training time.

Evaluation
Models were evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE).
scikit-learn is recommended for its faster performance in real-world deployment scenarios.

Usage
You can find the implementation in this repository, along with the code and results for both the custom and scikit-learn models.
